# ContactFormandPasswordGenerator
This PHP script validates user input on a contact form and generates a password for the user, then sends it in an email to the user.
Here are the specs that this project was written for:

Contact Form

Create a registration form that takes in a user's contact information such as name and email, and then emails the user a welcome email with login information and a random password.

•	The PHP program must validate the form to ensure all required fields have been filled in, and that the email address provided is valid. 

•	If any mistakes are found, it must redirect the user back to the form and explain only what needs to be fixed. No pre-existing messages for all boxes allowed.


When you are finished, hand in your two PHP scripts -- one should contain the form itself and the other should perform input processing.
